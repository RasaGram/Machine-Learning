# Machine-Learning

### Overview
Welcome to the Machine-Learning repository! This project leverages transfer learning using the MobileNetV2 model to classify images from a publicly available dataset. The objective is to fine-tune a pre-trained model to achieve accuracy 0.8 on our specific dataset.

### Tech Stack
The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Python: The main programming language used for implementing the machine learning models.
- Jupyter Notebook: For creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the machine learning models.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computing.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. It contains various features and target variables that will be used for training and testing the machine learning models.
